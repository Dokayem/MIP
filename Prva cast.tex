In recommendation systems, recommendation databases are one of the core datasets. The datasets contain several finite tuples forms where each parameter is the attribute. These attributes can be classified into two types: attributes of the objects being recommended and personal attributes of the users. The connections of the two groups mentioned above are often indicated by rating or preference score, which indicates how a user feels about a particular object or how much he/she is inclined to purchase it.
